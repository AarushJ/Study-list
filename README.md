This repository contains the list of commonly used terminology/concepts that usually are not programming language specific(but may be technology specific), and should be a part of my skillset, to be able to look at the detailed picture of a software I am building or studying, confidently.

1. HTTP Headers, Authentication and Authorization in detail
2. Lifecycle of an Android App and how to interact with a server side backend from an Android App
